As a community, we need to make it less difficult for those from underprivileged backgrounds. If you’re in the tech industry and truly care about diversifying the workforce, and not just by hiring more white and Asian women, you can help. There are plenty of ways to volunteer your time in neighborhoods you’re likely gentrifying. Become a mentor at iMentor. Become an instructor for ScriptEd (I’m planning on it). Attend student hackathons like the one at P-Tech. Get involved with Coalition for Queens. Just do something, and stop thinking that programming is “creating something from nothing,” because “nothing” actually translates to quite a bit of privilege.

*What are the barriers we as the most diverse Fellowship class that is non-college educated will face once we enter the working world?
I think most of employers are still unsure about how well we would have learnt in Fellowship class or employers are just have no idea how a web development vocational school or what we famously call "BOOTCAMP" might be as good as or even better than CS graduates. However, most of current companies who knows about such education exist love it, and we all can see and prove it from Flatiron School third-party CPA result #http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/105861788571/accountability-in-education-the-flatiron-school.
Other than that, I think most employer are afraid of hiring someone from a different social-education background, in this case, they are not sure how well would we work and fit in well as the part of the team they currently have.

*What is code switching, and is it something we should have to do?
Code switching is a practice of mixing or using elements  of two or more dialects or language in a single conversation.
Absolutely! Eventhough it has no place in proper formal language use, but who still do that?
Speaking more than one language is awesome! It has so much opportunity and goodness in general. The thing to make it works is the code-switcher need to make sure what they say make sense and understandable, and in the other side the listener should accept and listen to what he says.

*Should we change ourselves so that other people will understand us?
As a living person, everyone does change.
As a part of social society, we should make ourself understandable by the others.
But, change should be make to improve ourself comfortably and not forcefully for someone else.

*What does it mean to be an effective communicator?
To be good enough talking about a topic where general audience could understand and have interest into whatever you are saying.

*What do we have to do to be respected, listened to, and heard?
Respect others to be respected, and behave like someone deserve to be respected
Listen to others, be confident and proud of yourself or mean what you are trying to say so people will hear you.

*Do you believe the field you’re about to enter wants you to succeed?
I believe that you are your own success. People/co-worker/fellows/company/employers/others indeed want your success when you ask them. But they are not the effort, yourself is the key and the decision you made matters to your success.
I believe people find out others valuable so they can build their own path of success. Including ourself, so if people found there is something valuable in you, they would like to use, invest, pair with you to be their successor. However, success is a very fuzzy measurement of achievement. Something you think is a success could be nothing to others.


*How can we as a class challenge people’s preconceptions of who we are?
I think by studying hard and do our best more than people expectations what it could be. Make them suprised with us. I think we are in a system where in future it could substitute pricey, ineffective higher level of education. So, show them!
